# VitalWave

VitalWave is a web application designed to assist users in finding suitable hospitals based on various personal and medical criteria, including age, sex, location, underlying health conditions, symptoms, and preferred time slots. The application integrates Google Maps to provide a seamless location-based search experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic User Input Form:**
  - Collects details such as age, sex, location, underlying health conditions, symptoms, and preferred time slots.
  - Validates inputs for accuracy and relevance.

- **Google Maps Integration:**
  - Displays nearby hospitals based on user location.
  - Provides interactive map markers with information windows for each hospital.

- **Server-Side Processing:**
  - Uses Node.js and Express to handle API requests and process data.
  - Parses CSV files to fetch and sort hospital data according to user requirements.

- **Machine Learning:**
  - Employs a Naive Bayes classifier to assess the urgency of the user's condition (emergency or non-emergency).

## Instructions to Compile and Run the Project for Judges

### Overview
This is a simple React App (Next.js) with a Node.js API running in the background.

### Prerequisites
You will need Node.js and npm installed on your system.

### Steps

1. Start the API (run the below commands from the root folder):
   ```bash
   cd api
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. On a different terminal, start the Next.js app (run the below commands from the root folder):
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   npm install
   npm run start:dev
   ```

3. Once both servers are running simultaneously on two different terminals, visiting `http://localhost:3000` should load the application.
